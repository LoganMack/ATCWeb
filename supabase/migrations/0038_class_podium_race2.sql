-- Mirrors 0037_class_and_scoring_fixes.sql's base_points.sprint_race2
-- override, but for the class-podium ("D-Pos") bonus — Logan: ATC13's
-- sprint race 2 paid different class-podium points (5/3/1) than sprint
-- race 1 (3/2/1), same shape of difference the finish-points table already
-- had. class_podium.sprint_race2, if present, is used for every sprint
-- race after the first; otherwise every sprint race keeps using
-- class_podium.sprint exactly as before, so this is a pure opt-in.
--
-- Also confirmed: ATC12-and-earlier rulesets have no class_podium key at
-- all (no class-podium bonus existed yet). That already degrades safely —
-- `coalesce(v_rules->'class_podium'->'applies_to', '[]'::jsonb) ? c.class_name`
-- evaluates to false against the empty-array fallback when class_podium is
-- entirely missing, so class_points is 0 for everyone and nothing crashes.
-- This migration doesn't change that guard, just adds the same race-2
-- override on top of it that base_points already has.
