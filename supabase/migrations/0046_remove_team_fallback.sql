-- Alpha Touring Challenge — stop falling back to a driver's current team
-- when scoring a race
--
-- 0045_team_rosters_in_scoring.sql made team_rosters (season-scoped) win
-- over drivers.team_id (current team) when a season-specific roster entry
-- exists, but still fell back to the current team when one didn't. Per
-- Logan: remove that fallback entirely. A driver with no team_rosters entry
-- for a given season should show as being on no team that season, full
-- stop — not silently inherit whatever team they're on today. This also
-- matches reality better: plenty of drivers were team-less for years before
-- joining a team, and the fallback was papering over that by always
-- assigning a team once they eventually got one.
--
-- Confirmed before shipping this: as of today, only 57 driver-seasons carry
-- an explicit team_rosters entry; 215 driver-seasons across 21 other teams
-- have only ever been getting their team from this fallback. Removing it
-- means those 215 driver-seasons will show "no team" (blank team column,
-- excluded from every team's roster/stats) until team_rosters is backfilled
-- for them — a real, visible, site-wide regression in team display until
-- that backfill happens. Logan confirmed he wants this anyway.
--
-- The only change from 0045: `coalesce(tr.team_id, d.team_id)` becomes
-- plain `tr.team_id` (null when no roster entry exists for this season).
-- class_id's own coalesce(dsc.class_id, d.class_id) fallback is UNCHANGED —
-- this migration is scoped to team_id only, per what was actually asked
-- for. Everything else in this function is identical to 0045.
--
-- After this ships, every season needs a re-run of recalculate_season_scores()
-- to actually rewrite race_scores.team_id on already-computed rows.
